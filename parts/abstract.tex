The quantity of video information has dramatically increased in the last decade, owing to advances in multimedia applications and in bandwidth.  This exponential growth of video data demands better video analysis techniques.  \textit{Event spotting} is one of the most important video analysis techniques, that basically identifies the temporal range of an event.

This report discusses different experiments for spotting of events in videos based on video queries, using DNN features.  It also contains a novel method for event recognition in video using Convolutional Neural Networks.  This report also includes a description of efficient in-house implementation of Deep Neural Networks which can be run on both CPU and GPU architectures.
