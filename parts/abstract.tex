The amount of video information has dramatically increased in last decade fueled by the advancement of multimedia. This exponential growth of the video data, demands for better video analysis techniques. The event spotting is one of most important video analysis technique It is process of identification of the temporal range of the event. 

This report discuss different experiments for spotting events in videos based on video queries, using deep bottleneck features. It also contain a novel method for event recognition for video using Convolutional Neural Network. This report also include a description of efficient in-house implementation of Deep Neural Networks which can be run on both CPU and GPU architectures.
