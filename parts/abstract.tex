The amount of video information has dramatically increased in the last decade, owing to advancement in multimedia application and bandwidth.  This exponential growth of the video data demands better video analysis techniques.  The \textit{event spotting} is one of the most important video analysis techniques, that basically identifies the temporal range of an event.

This report discusses different experiments for spotting of events in videos based on video queries, using deep bottleneck features.  It also contain a novel method for event recognition for video using Convolutional Neural Network.  This report also includes a description of efficient in-house implementation of Deep Neural Networks which can be run on both CPU and GPU architectures
